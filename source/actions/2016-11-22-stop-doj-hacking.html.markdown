Call your Senator and demand they hold hearings on
[Rule 41](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/bipartisan-coalition-presses-doj-about-government-hacking),
which will give the Dept. of Justice
[access to thousands or millions of computers with a single warrant](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/10/14/lawmakers-try-stop-mass-hacking-americans-computers-feds/91730146/).
