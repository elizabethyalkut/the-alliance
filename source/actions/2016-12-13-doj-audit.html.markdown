The Department of Justice is tallying phone calls about demands for an audit of the 2016 election. Call, choose option number 4, and leave a message for the Attorney General's office. Just state your full name, that you are a US citizen, where you live, and that you support an audit of the 2016 presidential election. These things are tallies. Make it easy for them.
