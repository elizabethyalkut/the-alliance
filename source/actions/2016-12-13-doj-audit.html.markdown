The Department of Justice is **tallying phone calls** about demands for an audit.
*Let's make it easy for them.* Call, choose option number 4, and leave a message
for the Attorney General's office. Then state your full name, that you are a US
citizen, where you live, and that you support an audit of the 2016 presidential
election.
