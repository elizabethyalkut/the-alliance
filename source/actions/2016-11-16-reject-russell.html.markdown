The [Russell Amendment](https://www.washingtonblade.com/2016/10/25/dems-sound-alarm-over-potential-anti-lgbt-provision-in-defense-bill/)
would let some bosses fire people for being LGBT, using birth control,
or being pregnant and unmarried. You could be refused a job interview based on
religious beliefs.
